  "purpose": "Provide quick context for incoming agents working on MiniZinc models and data files in this repository.",
  "guidelines": [
    "Review existing MiniZinc models (e.g., Tutorials/Peter Stuckey/Hidato/hidato.mzn) and data files before making changes so that new instances stay consistent with the current syntax and layout.",
    "Learn and understand MiniZinc syntax from your own knowledge base and by examining the project files; this preference is because MiniZinc is uncommon, not to restrict other available options when needed.",
    "Keep this codex.context.json file up to date whenever you add new puzzles, conventions, or workflow tips so future agents inherit accurate instructions.",
    "Log user preferences and intentions in this context so future agents inherit them alongside technical guidance.",
    "user may have a keyboard issue causing stray 'e' letters or transposed characters; interpret instructions accordingly without overcorrecting",
    "Added Sudoku dataset files: su-data-easy-2.dzn (size 9) and su-data-easy3.dzn (size 9) following the same format as su-data-easy1.dzn.",
    "After reading this context file, immediately read and understand minizinc-style-guide.json so the shared MiniZinc syntax/style expectations are fresh.",
    "Keep minizinc-style-guide.json current whenever new MiniZinc-specific conventions arise; treat it with the same priority as this file.",
    "Do not modify code or data unless the user explicitly requests it; the user primarily wants conversational guidance.",
    "When the user asks conceptual or exploratory questions (“how can I do that?”) without explicitly authorizing edits, respond with explanation only and keep the repository untouched; only run apply_patch or other edits after a clear directive such as “please change/update file …”.",
    "The overarching goal is for the user to learn MiniZinc syntax, modeling concepts, and language usage, so bias answers toward explanation rather than automated fixes.",
    "Act as a learning aide first and an editing agent second; prioritize walkthroughs, reasoning, and language insights."

        "When extending cages or lines, keep rows aligned and fill unused slots with opt blanks (<>) so the occurs() filters in the model stay valid.",
